# Hack-A-Duck

Theme 1: You plan to start an essentials delivery system. Develop an
App or a Website where people can order the listed essential goods &
delivery partners can deliver the same to the mentioned locations.

Theme 2: You are a Quizmaster and plan to create a Website to
organize Online Quizzes & also host a set of quizzes for the participants.

The Project Must be very User - Friendly where participants can practice
the quizzes & check their progress. Also, include features like discussion
sections Or Upvotes/DownVotes.

Theme 3: During this hard time you thought of a platform where people
can donate the essentials & those who are in need can ask for the same.
Create a crowdfunding & awareness website to perform the same with
verification portal through administrator which verifies the document
when you ask for donations/help.

Theme 4: Your friend is good at blogging and wishes to have an online
presence. Help him out by Designing a website for the same, to feature his works with integrated CMS/ Admin Portal so that he can edit/add/delete the blogs without any proper coding sense.
